The Context API is a built-in feature in React that allows you to share data
 and state across components without having to pass props manually through every
  level of the component tree, a problem known as "prop drilling". It is ideal for
   managing global state like themes, authentication status, or user preferences

   create context
   -first,use the createContext function from react to create a context object

   provider-wrap the components that need access to thhee shared data with the context's provider component.
   The provider accepts a value prop  which holds the data you want to share.

   useContext-
   usecontext is aReact Hook that simplifies accessing data from react's context api allowing components to
    subscribe to contextapi allowing components to subscribe to context changes and consume shared data(like themes,user auth)
    without prop drilling, by reading values from  the nearest context provider up the componets tree,avoiding mannual prop
    passing through intermidate components
